# Gender_Classification with pytorch
## classify images containing  male &amp; female

This is the implementation of Age and Gender Classification using PyTorch as the deep 
learning framework and Google Colab as the training ground.

. we use kaggle api dataset in google colab
. use convolutional neural network with 5 convolution layers

# Datasets :
The data set is of cropped images of male and female. It is split into training and validation directory.
Training contains ~23,000 images of each class and the validation directory contains ~5,500 images of each class.

Dataset is from Kaggle. Link => https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

# known issues
training this model taking a lot of time so we will use transfer learning soon...
